# AI-Powered Cinnamon Grading System

The grading process of cinnamon products remains inconsistent, which creates problems for market pricing and supply chain management and product distribution. The manual grading process remains both time-consuming and inconsistent while being subjective which results in supply chain mismatches and revenue losses and product waste. A computerized system needs to exist for Ceylon cinnamon quality classification into High, Medium and Low grades through chemical composition analysis. A predictive machine learning model can identify complex nonlinear connections between chemical properties and quality grades by analyzing twelve essential parameters which include Moisture, Ash, Volatile Oil, Acid Insoluble Ash, Chromium, Coumarin etc. The model provides quick and uniform quality evaluations at scale which helps organizations maintain quality standards and set prices and meet export requirements and optimize their supply chain operations.
